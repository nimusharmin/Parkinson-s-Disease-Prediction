Parkinson's Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects a significant portion of the population over 50 years of age. Patients often face mobility challenges and speech difficulties, making frequent hospital visits difficult. Early detection of PD is crucial, as it allows timely treatment and enables patients to maintain a normal lifestyle.

This project demonstrates the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in telemedicine to detect PD in its early stages. We used the MDVP audio dataset, which contains voice recordings from 31 individuals, including 23 patients with Parkinson’s Disease and healthy subjects.

Six ML models were trained and evaluated:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest (RF)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression (LR)

Decision Tree (DT)

XGBoost

Among these, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 95% in detecting PD. Additionally, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was applied to analyze feature importance and interpret model predictions.

The results of this project highlight the potential of ML in telemedicine, offering a remote, accurate, and early detection solution for Parkinson's Disease patients.
